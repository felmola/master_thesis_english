    <p>
        This is the first part of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        On your computer screen addition problems of five numbers of two digits each will appear, one at a time. These
        addition problems are randomly generated by the computer. You will have to solve as many problems as you can in
        two periods of four minutes each. At the end of each period, you will see on the screen your number of correct
        and incorrect answers. You will accumulate 1,000 points for each correctly solved problem in the first period.
        At the end of the first period, you can face two events. In the first event, with a probability of 50% (which
        is the same probability that when flipping a coin, it will land on heads), you can keep all of the points that
        you have accumulated for this period or lose half of them. In the second event, with a probability of 50% (which
        is the same probability that when flipping a coin, it will land on heads), it may happen that each correctly
        solved problem in the second period still gives you 1,000 points or just 500 points. This means that you may
        find yourself in a situation in which you are in either of the two events, in both events, or in neither of the
        events.
    </p>
    <p>To perform the addition task, if you wish to, you can use the blank sheet of paper in front of you. The better
        your performance, the higher your earnings in this first task. Accumulated earnings in this task will be paid
        with certainty at the end of this activity, along with the earnings of the task drawn from amongst the other
        four tasks of the second part.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each correct answer in this activity, you will receive 1,000 points. At the end of the exercise, points that
        constitute your payment will be converted to Colombian pesos. Each point is equivalent to 1 Colombian peso.
