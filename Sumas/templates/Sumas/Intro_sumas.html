    <p>
        This is the first part of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        In your computer screen will appear, one at a time, addition problems of five numbers of two digits each. These
        addition problems are randomly generated by the computer. You have to solve as many problems as you can
        in two periods of four minutes each. At the end of each period you will see on the screen the number of correct
        and incorrect answers you had. You will accumulate 1000 points for each correctly solved problem in the first
        period. At the end of the first period you can face two events. In the first event, with a probability of 50%,
        that is, with the same probability that when flipping a coin it lands on heads, you can keep all the points you
        accumulated for this period or lose half of them. In the second event, with a probability of 50%, that is, with
        the same probability that when flipping a coin it lands on heads, it may happen that each correctly solved
        problem in the second period still gives you 1000 points, or just 500 points. This means that you may see
        yourself in a situation in which you are in any of the two events, in both, or in none.
    </p>
    <p>To perform the additions, if you wish you can use the blank paper sheet in
        front of you. The better your performance the higher your earnings in this first task. Accumulated earnings in
        this part will be paid with certainty at the end of the activity along with the earnings of the task drawn among
        the other four tasks of the second part.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each correct answer you get in this activity you will receive 1000 points. At the end of the exercise, points
        that constitute your payment will be converted to colombian pesos. Each point is equivalent to 1 Colombian Peso.
